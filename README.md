# Analysis of adult dataset

Authors: Ali Bektas, Alper Savas, Matthias Krug <br>
Date: 16 Dez 2021

### Goal

#### Project 01

The goal is to run a full data analysis for a given classification task. This analysis shall cover all necessary steps from preprocessing to evaluation of the results. Moreover, different classification models have to be investigated and conclusions on their performance have to be drawn. Finally, evaluation measures, experimental setup and parameter selection should be discussed and your analysis decisions should be justified.

#### Project 02

The goal is to run a cluster analysis for a given task. This analysis shall cover all necessary steps from preprocessing to evaluation of the results. Moreover, two different clustering algorithms have to be investigated and conclusions on their performance have to be drawn on the resulting clusters. Finally, evaluation measures, experimental setup and parameter selection should be discussed and your analysis decisions should be justified.
